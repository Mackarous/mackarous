## Hi there 👋

I've been a mobile dev since 2012. I started on Android, but now mostly do iOS.

- ✍️ I write a blog at [Swift.Mackarous](swift.mackarous.com) where I share tips, tutorials, and insights about Swift and SwiftUI.
- 🗞️ I also write a weekly newsletter at [news.mackarous.com](https://news.mackarous.com) where I roundup articles that I've read and found inspiring that week.
- 🗻 I love traveling, and you can find more about me at [mackarous.com](https://mackarous.com)

## Where to find me

Feel free to reach out if you want to collaborate on iOS projects, share ideas on SwiftUI, or just talk about tech and wellness!
